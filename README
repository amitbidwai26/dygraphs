The dygraphs JavaScript library produces produces interactive, zoomable charts of time series based on CSV files.

Features new to this fork
- Option: dataHasErrorBars -- For when the data has error bars but
          you dont necessarily want to draw them (or you want to toggle them)
- Option: shouldFill -- Works the same as plotkits shouldFill (makes an area graph)
- Option: stackedGraph -- Creates a stacked graph. Sets shouldFill 
          to true unless otherwise stated
- Option: highlightClosestPoint -- This will draw a red halo around the cloest
          point, and surround the associated label with the tag:
          <span class="highlight">LABEL</span>
- Auto-width: You no longer need to explicitly set the width, it will automatically
              find the width of the containing div on load (will not resize though)
- Correct drawing order: will draw the dots over the lines, this can look weird in some
                         situations but is generally more useful.
- Optimizations: General optimizations to speed things up significantly
